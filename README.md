# Springboard-Event-Ticket-System-Project

This repository contains the files for my submission of the Springboard Data Pipeline Mini-Project.

The goal of the project is to use Python to develop a 
[pipeline](ticketsales_pipeline.py)
script which reads in a csv file containing event ticket sales data:
[third_party_sales_1.csv](third_party_sales_1.csv)
and automatically exports its contents into a Mysql database table while also providing a summary of the most popular events based on ticket sales.

To demonstrate its efficacy, this pipeline script was run from a windows powershell terminal. The terminal output and subsequent mysql database changes are shown below:
